Microservices Project
This project is a microservices-based application that aims to provide various functionalities through its different components. It leverages Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and orchestration.

Services
The core of the application is composed of multiple microservices, each serving a specific purpose:

User Service
Handles user-related functionality, such as user management, authentication, and authorization.
Account Service
Manages user accounts and related operations, such as account creation, retrieval, and updates.
Loan Service
Manages loan-related operations, such as loan applications, approvals, and tracking.
Transaction Service
Deals with transaction management, including recording and processing financial transactions.
Auth Service
Provides authentication and authorization capabilities for secure access to the application's resources.
Gateway
Acts as an entry point for all external requests and performs functions such as routing, load balancing, and authentication.
Eureka Server
The project utilizes Eureka Server, a service registry and discovery server. Each microservice registers itself with the Eureka Server, allowing other services to locate and interact with it easily.

Config Server
The Config Server is responsible for managing configuration properties for the microservices. It centralizes the configuration management, making it easier to update and maintain various service configurations.

MongoDB
For data storage, the project employs MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. It is containerized and accessible through the Mongo service.

Usage
To run the project, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to start the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
Wait for the services to start. Once they are up and running, you can access the different services through their respective ports as specified in the docker-compose.yml file.
Conclusion
This microservices project demonstrates a scalable and modular architecture that enables independent development and deployment of different services. By leveraging Docker and Docker Compose, the project simplifies the containerization and orchestration of the services, making it easier to manage and maintain the entire system.

Feel free to explore each microservice's code and configuration to further understand the project's functionalities and implementation details.
